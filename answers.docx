Q1) What do you know about docker and can any app be dockerized?
•	The concept is of docker for me to understand is, to use containers, to make the software shipped as one unit containing the program and all its dependencies, instead of shipping individual pieces with the risk of missing one of them. So that we can avoid any dependencies missing in different environment (development, testing and production). It is a software container framework.
•	Yes, we can dockerize any application
Q2) Describe CI/CD pipeline and give an example of it?
•	Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Deployment. It automates the process of software delivery. It is configured to builds code, run test, and safely deployed a version of software. Important stages are source(code repository), build(merge and build a instance potentially to ship to end user), test(config automated validation tests) and deploy(go into production and deploy on live server)
•	Example such as hosting code on github, use and configure github actions to automate the software workflows.
Q3) Are serverless backend really serverless?
It does not mean there are no servers together. It indicates that the management of the servers is completely delegated to the cloud provider. In serverless model, the servers are automatically provisioned and started whenever needed and terminated when they are not.
Q4) What is R-CNN, name a few use cases
•	To starts with the concept convolution (spatial-domain filtering), the convolution of two discrete signal I(I,j) and g(I,j) gives anther signal I0(I,j). The CNN basically compare two images piece by piece by making a filter/proposal(g(I,j)) from one image, simply multiply the filter with the corresponding pixel(I(I,j)), sum the products and divide by the total number of pixels in that filter(feature) place result in corresponding pixel in output image. Follow “raster scan” to process the whole image(I(I,j)). By watching the result image, a proposal match shows number closer to 1, instead a proposal not match shows number closer to -1.  The R-CNN extracts many region(2000) of proposals at multiple scales from the input image, uses CNN to perform convolution on target image to extract its features, then uses these features to predict the class and bounding box of the region proposal.
•	It is largely used for object detection for recognizing patterns, shapes, colors and textures
